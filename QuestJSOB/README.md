# JSOB Questions & Answers

The mission is to use a J.S.O.N friendly editor (like Notepad++ - recommended!) to manage a collection of questions. Spell checking is also a great feature of all modern programming editors?

The sub-mission of the project is also to uniquely identify each and every Quest()ion.

To get started, simply run the GUI (below) and create a **[New]** project.

# GUI File Manager
The Quest()ion importation / exportation / sharing strategy is MainGUI.py. 

## Key operations include:

**[New]** – Create a new .json file, with a default entry to clone / update.

**[Source]** – Load a previously created .json file.

**[Reload]** – Reload + renumber a .json file.

**[Report]** – Tag, tally, and show counts for categories, classifications, and grand totals.

**[About]** – Display project name, and version.

**[Encode]** – Show what an encoded, selected entry, would look like.

**[Decode]** – Reverse the **[Encode]**

**[Copy]** – Copy the clipboard content into the main viewer (‘staging area’.)

**[Paste]** – **[Encode]** and paste a selected item to the clipboard – usually for sharing.

**[Keep]** – Save the entry into the active .json file.


Note that each question is granted a global identified (GID.) While we can manually have duplicates, the '**[Keep]**' operation requires that any 'kept' (imported) GID to be unique. Either (1) enter manually, or (2) put a duplicate into a **[New]** JSOB file.

Status: Testing Release
Version: 1.0
